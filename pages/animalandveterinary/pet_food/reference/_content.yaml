- "## About"
- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates that can of cat food, bag of dog food, or box of dog treats or snacks in your pantry. The FDA’s regulation of pet food is similar to that for other animal foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires that all animal foods, like human foods, be safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.
- There is no requirement that pet food products have pre-market approval by the FDA. However, FDA ensures that the ingredients used in pet food are safe and have an appropriate function in the pet food. Many ingredients such as meat, poultry and grains are considered safe and do not require pre-market approval. Other substances such as sources of minerals, vitamins or other nutrients, flavorings, preservatives, or processing aids may be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for an intended use (21 CFR 582 and 584) or must have approval as food additives (21 CFR 570, 571 and 573). Colorings must have approvals for that use as specified in 21 CFR 70 and be listed in Parts 73, 74, or 81.

- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - meta.disclaimer
  - meta.license
  - meta.last_updated
  - meta.results.skip
  - meta.results.limit
  - meta.results.total
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching adverse event reports returned by the API."
- "Each SPL record consists of three sets of fields:"
- ul:
  - "Standard SPL fields, including unique identifiers."
  - "Product-specific fields, the order and contents of which are unique to each product."
  - "An **openFDA** section: An annotation with additional product identifiers, such as UPC and brand name, of the drug products listed in the labeling."
- "#### Field variation"
- Fields vary with the particular product being documented. Some fields are rarely used. Most prescription drug product labeling will feature similar fields, and those fields will contain similar content. Over-the-counter (OTC) drug product labeling will generally feature a different set of fields.
- The specific requirements for content of these fields vary from product to product. General descriptions of the fields are provided below, along with notable exceptions or exceptional cases. Expect variation.
- FDA regulations describe these fields more thoroughly than this documentation. The following documents may be useful for more information about [prescription drug product labeling](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.57) and [over-the-counter (OTC) drug product labeling](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.57).
- Some fields are considered by the SPL specification as subsections of other fields, but labeling is not always formatted according to the specification. For example, information about prescription drugs’ potential `teratogenic effects` are ordinarily encoded in the teratogenic_effects field, found after (as a subsection of) the `pregnancy` field. However, some labels combine all the content into the `pregnancy` field and do not have a `teratogenic_effects` field. Again, expect variation.
- Some labeling features data encoded in the wrong fields. These errors may be corrected in subsequent versions of the product labeling.
- "#### Field order"
- Fields are ordered naturally, as they were found in the original product labeling. Expect variation in field order from product to product.
- "## Field-by-field reference"
- Fields and their contents will vary from product to product. Some species don't include breeds, for example. The following descriptions are as accurate as possible but do not cover all the potential variation among field contents.
- This page groups fields conceptually for ease of reference. In API results, fields will be ordered naturally as in the pet food record.
- "### Product Information"
- "These fields detail the product referred to in the pet food record."
- example: results
- fields:
  - product_name
  - flavor
  - formulation
  - manufacturer_or_distributer
- "### Animal Information"
- "These fields identify the animals affected and their traits."
- fields:
  - species
  - breed
  - age
  - age_uom
  - weight
  - weight_uom
  - gender
  - reproductive_status
- "### Adverse effect information"
- fields:
  - number_of_animals_given_the_product
  - number_of_animals_reacted
  - number_of_animals_died
  - low_level_term
  - llt_freq
- "datasets"
