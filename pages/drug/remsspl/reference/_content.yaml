- "## About REMS SPL"
- The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. A REMs may be required by the FDA as part of the approval of a new product, or for an approved product when new safety information arises. Essentially, a REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. Each REMS has specific safety measures unique to the safety risks associated with a particular drug or class of drugs.
- The FDA has begun accepting REMS in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format to facilitate making REMS information available within existing healthcare systems and workflows. SPL can be used to capture and present REMS information in a format that is easily shared with stakeholders and readily incorporated into health information technology.
- For more information about REMS, see the [FDA Basics Webinar - A Brief Overview of REMS](https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm325201.htm).
- The openFDA REMS SPL API returns REMS data that has been submitted to the FDA electronically using the REMS SPL format.

- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - meta.disclaimer
  - meta.license
  - meta.last_updated
  - meta.results.skip
  - meta.results.limit
  - meta.results.total
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching REMS SPL data returned by the API."
- "Each SPL record consists of three sets of fields:"
- ul:
  - "Standard SPL fields, including unique identifiers."
  - "REMS data containing related documents, goals, elements and products."
  - "An **openFDA** section: An annotation with additional product identifiers, such as UPC and brand name, of the drug products listed in the products."
- "Here are common REMS SPL sections you may see:"
- ul:
  - "`related_documents` referenced by `set_id`"
  - "`rems_elements` describing `medication_guide`,`implementation_system`, `submission_assessments` and `rems_summary` "
  - "`rems_goals` outlining the `goals`"
  - "`products` outlining the `manufactured_product` and `marketing_info`"
- "## Field-by-field description"
- This page groups fields conceptually for ease of reference. In API results, fields will be ordered naturally as in the product labeling submission.
- "### ID and version"
- "All REMS SPL records contain these fields, which uniquely identify individual records."
- example: results
- fields:
  - set_id
  - id
  - version
  - effective_time
  - title
  - sponsor_name
- "### Related documents"
- fields:
  - related_spl_document_set_id
- "### SPL unclassified section"
- fields:
  - record_details
- "### REMS goals"
- fields:
  - goal
- "### Medication guide"
- fields:
  - guide_information
- "### REMS elements"
- fields:
  - safe_use_conditions
  - safe_use_monitoring
  - implementation
  - rems_submission_assessments_timetable
- "### Substance administration"
- fields:
  - stakeholder_name
  - stakeholder_code
  - requirement
  - reference_id
- "### REMS material"
- fields:
  - name
  - reference
- "### REMS products"
- fields:
  - generic_name
  - brand_name
  - package_type
  - approval_holder_org
  - application_number
- "### OpenFDA fields"
- Different datasets use different drug identifiersâ€”brand name, generic name, NDA, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets.
- OpenFDA features harmonization of drug identifiers, to make it easier to connect REMS SPL records to other drug information. Drug products that appear in FAERS records are joined to the NDC dataset first on brand name, and if there is no brand name, on generic name. If that is succesful, further links are established to other datasets. The linked data is listed as an `openfda` annotation in the patient.drug section of a result.
